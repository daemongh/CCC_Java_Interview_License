      <question>
        How do I keep the licensing plugin from filtering a specific source file?
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
        You'll need to either override the ignored filters set (provided in ${project.parent.artifactId}) or submit a PR against the plugin in <code>cccparent</code>.
       <br/>There's an <code>excludes</code> tag.  Look for <code><![CDATA[<artifactId>license-maven-plugin</artifactId>]]></code>
